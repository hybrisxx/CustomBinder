CustomBinder allows you to assign specific spells directly to keybindings without using valuable action bar slots. 

After installing the addon, you can bind keys to commonly used spells like "Hearthstone", "Fishing", and others directly through the Key Bindings menu under the Custom Binder section. 

To add or change custom spells, you must edit both CustomBinder.lua and Bindings.xml:
- Define a function in CustomBinder.lua using the exact spell name.
- Add a corresponding <Binding> entry in Bindings.xml that calls that function.
